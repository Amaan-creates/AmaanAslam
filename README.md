# 👋 Hi, I’m Amaan

I'm a commercially minded operator with 3+ years of experience in business development and go-to-market execution — now transitioning into AI-driven product environments.

After generating over £1.4M in revenue for a leading global events firm, I pursued a Master’s in AI & Digital Innovation at the London School of Economics (MISDI), where I focused on the intersection of emerging technologies and product strategy.
